# Mirelucky

> Mirelucky is a Fallout2d20 dice roller I'm developing for the Fallout TTRPG community!

## To-do priority list

[BEING IMPLEMENTED] Roll log section

[DONE] Make dice stuff larger

[DONE] Section which totals the dice results, both for Combat Dice and for d20s

[NEXT ON THE LIST] Button to change page language (English > PT-BR)

[WILL BE DONE] Alternate hit locations (Quadraped, Mr. Handy, Flying)

[MIGHT NOT BE DONE] Adjustable size of buttons

[NOT HAPPENING] Rolling loot

[NOT HAPPENING] 3d dice rolling animations

## Future plans

- Make it session-based using websocket so players and GMs can see eachother's rolls.
